# Debiandroid

This is the code I use to run Debian on my Android device.

The file _packages.txt_ was generated by running _get\_packages.sh_ in a Debian machine.

## Installation

Install [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases)

Open the app and in the terminal run:

```sh
apt update
yes | apt install proot openssl wget binutils
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donno2048/Debiandroid/master/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

## Usage

Open Termux and run (you might need to exit Termux and open it again):

```sh
debian
```
